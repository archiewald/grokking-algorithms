## 2.1

Linked list is better. It has O(1) insert time and O(n) read time. Also linked lists are fine for reading if you read one by one in order.

## 2.2

A linked list. We put order on beginning and delete from the end. No random access needed.

## 2.3

Sorted array. You can get quickly to the middle of the list with an array.

## 2.4

For binary sort you would keep elements sorted. When you insert an element in an array you need to shift all the elements after and it is possible you get out of space.

## 2.5

| hybrid | array    | linked list |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| search | h slower | h faster    |
| insert | h faster | same as h   |
